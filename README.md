TestObjectBuildersCsharp
========================
TestObjectBuildersCsharp allows you to quickly create builder 
classes that put together classes under test.

# Background
I liked Nat Pryce's Test Data Builders (http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html) 
for instantiating classes under test in unit tests, however, I didn't like writing 
a builder for each class.

This tool allows you to dynamically create builders for classes under test. 

# Installation
* Download the TestObjectBuilder project and add to your solution.
* Reference TestObjectBuilder project from the project that contains your unit tests.
