**********************
*** Handling Dynamic Assemblies
Currently a new Dynamic Assembly is created for each dynamically created builder.
An alternative would be to create a dynamic assembly once and use it again and again
(E.G. like https://github.com/castleproject/Castle.DynamicProxy-READONLY).  This also
allows you to cache dynamic types that you've built once already.

Can Castle.DynamicProxy (or a similar framework) be used to create TestObjectBuilders?

**********************
*** PropertiesUsedByProductConstructor
Change the way that PropertiesUsedByProductConstructor is stored as this could
possibly clash with a property on the type the builder will build.

**********************
*** Rename TestObjectConstructorArgument and TestObjectConstructorArgumentList
These are long names and make building a builder look a lot more complicated than it is.
